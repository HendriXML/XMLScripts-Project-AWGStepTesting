# XMLScripts-Project-AWGStepTesting
XMLScript project that allows measuring the steps between different input values

What's needed to use this script?
* SAG1021
* NI VISA setup (It uses a COM interface that comes with it)
* Ethernet/Wifi connection on Scope (Using the above with USB fails)
* Interpreter executable (64 bit Windows, developed by me)
* Script + Script libraries
* XML editor to alter some values (for example an offset to get the first batch in view, scopes ip-adress). I really like the free Visual Studio Community for that.
* about 2 hours of executing time
